# Summary

This code was straightforward to codecheck. As per the documentation, there was a `renv` lockfile located in the `0_SoftwareEnvironment` folder. I created an `.RProj` file in the root directory and copied over the lock file so that upon executing `renv::restore()` it would be easily recognised. I updated my R version to match the lockfile too. The AbSolution package itself was installed from the pre-existing `0_SoftwareEnvironment` folder using `install.packages("0_SoftwareEnvironment/R/AbSolution_0.0.5.9550.tar", repos = NULL, type="source")`. 

I could then knit the RMarkdown file and it executed with no errors first time. The tables and figures are printed directly in the HTML output. The figures are interactive. For the purposes of this codecheck, I made a screenshot of each one. The resulting HTML output file matches the given file as expected. I did not test the docker file as the outputs were reproduced on a Windows machine using `renv` so there was no need to delve into this.

## Recommendations

The project was straightforward to reproduce so there are no specific recommendations for improvement.

# Manifest files

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis", width=100}
for(i in c(1:nrow(manifest_df))) {
  path <- manifest_df[i,"dest"]
  if(stringr::str_ends(path, "(png|pdf|jpg|jpeg)")) {
    # include graphics with knitr has to happen at top level in chunks, see https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1260
    # see also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51268623/insert-images-using-knitrinclude-graphics-in-a-for-loop
    # knitr::include_graphics(manifest_df[1, "dest"], error = TRUE)
    # Therefore, generate Markdown code here:
    cat("## ", basename(path), "\n\n")
    cat("**Comment:** ", manifest_df[i,"comment"], "\n\n")
    cat(paste0("![", "Test ", "](", path, ")\n"))

    cat("## ", basename(path), "\n\n")
    cat("\\scriptsize \n\n", "```txt\n")
    cat(readLines(path), sep = "\n")
    cat("\n\n``` \n\n", "\\normalsize \n\n")

# About CODECHECK

This certificate confirms that the codechecker could independently
reproduce the results of a computational analysis given the data and
code from a third party.  A CODECHECK does not check whether the
original computation analysis is correct.  However, as all materials
required for the reproduction are freely available by following the
links in this document, the reader can then study for themselves the
code and data.
